- **OpenAI & LangChain Integration**: State-of-the-art natural language understanding powers accurate SQL and CSV data insights.
- **Streamlit Interface**: An intuitive and interactive interface to work with both SQL databases and CSV files.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python**: Core functionality for data querying and processing.
- **LangChain**: Chatbot framework for conversational data interactions.
- **OpenAI API**: For natural language understanding and query generation.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Manages SQL databases and executes generated queries.
- **Streamlit**: Provides a user-friendly interface for both SQL and CSV operations.
- **Pandas & PandasAI**: For CSV data manipulation and analysis.
  
## How It Works üí°

1. **Ask in Plain English**: Whether you're working with a SQL database or a CSV file, you can ask questions like "What are the top 10 selling products?" or "Show me data for purchases made last month."
   
2. **SQL Query or CSV Insights**: 
   - For SQL databases, SpeakQL will generate and run the necessary SQL queries.
   - For CSV files, SpeakQL uses PandasAI to answer questions and provide insights.

3. **Chat with Your Data**: Use the LangChain-powered chatbot to ask follow-up questions, refine queries, or explore your data in a natural dialogue.

## Usage üîß

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speakql.git

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Example Queries

1. **SQL Example**  
   Input: **"Show me the top 5 customers by sales."**  
   SpeakQL will generate the SQL query:
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_name, SUM(sales) 
   FROM sales_data 
   GROUP BY customer_name 
   ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

2. **CSV Example**  
   Input: **"What‚Äôs the average purchase value in this CSV?"**  
   SpeakQL will analyze the CSV data using PandasAI and provide the result.

## Versions and Extensibility üîç

SpeakQL unifies two powerful modes of data interaction:
- **SQL Database Mode**: Perfect for users who need to perform dynamic queries on relational databases.
- **CSV Analysis Mode**: Ideal for those working with static data in CSV format, with all the power of Pandas for analysis and visualization.
